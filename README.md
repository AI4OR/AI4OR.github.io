Title: A Network for Context-Aware Operating Theaters
Acronym: AI4OR

Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is projected to deeply transform the practice of medicine and bring socioeconomic
changes along with these transformations. This is largely due to the recent advances in machine learning,
especially deep learning, which demonstrated a breakthrough performance in human perception tasks such
as object recognition and natural language processing. Achieving human-like competence, AI is already
shaping the future of medical imaging diagnostics, personalized medicine and clinical decision support
systems. Due to the unique environment and the complex nature of surgical procedures, however, AI has
taken longer to integrate with operating theaters. We believe that AI has tremendous potential to shape the
future of interventional healthcare by increasing safety, efficiency, precision and reproducibility in operating
theaters. The main aim of this Action is to create innovative solutions to context-awareness in operating
theaters, with a particular focus on surgical process modeling, analysis and recognition of surgical
processes, and cognitive surgical robotics, primarily using AI algorithms. This Action aims to advance this
emerging field via a bottom-up, interdisciplinary network of academics, clinicians, and industry partners with
a common goal of defining the technologies of the future AI powered, context-aware operating theaters. This
network will help democratize knowledge and expertise, and close the divide between renowned research
centers and small communities, train and mobilize young talents. It will help create a market of specific skills
by bringing academia, healthcare institutions and industry together, and help attract and keep young talents
in Europe. Moreover, it will give solid ground to multi-stakeholder research collaborations.
